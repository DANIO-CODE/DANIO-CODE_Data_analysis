# DANIO-CODE Data analysis

## 1. Purpose of the repository

To easily share data and results among collaborators. Here we should put all 
the code to produce the data as well as generated figures and tracks.

## 2. Repository organisation

- All the data should be organised in adequate folders
- Everything should be versioned in a way that the code produce the corresponding
versiobn of figure/track
- Code for generating figures and tracks shopuld preferably be stored as 
notebooks, so the code can be easily changed and rerun with appropriate 
dependencies.

## 3. Rules for the repository maintenance

- Code for generating figures and tracks shopuld preferably be stored as 
notebooks, so the code can be easily changed and rerun with appropriate dependancies. 
- Everything should be versioned in a way that the code produce the corresponding
versiobn of figure/track
- previous versions of tracks/figures should be kept, while the changes in code
should be present in form of comments
- The code should also contain the author, date of creation and date of last
update in the header
